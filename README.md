## Project Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Kubernetes resources, scripts, and notes, covering everything from cluster setup with Kind, Helm, and ArgoCD, to advanced topics like canary deployments, rolling updates, service mesh (Istio), policy enforcement (Kyverno), and more. It is ideal for learners, practitioners, and anyone looking to deepen their Kubernetes knowledge through practical exercises.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (or Linux/WSL)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/)
- [Istioctl](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/getting-started/)
- [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/)

## Getting Started

1. **Set up a local multi-node Kind cluster:**
   ```sh
   ./install-kind.sh
   ```

2 **Install Helm and ArgoCD:**
   ```sh
   ./install-helm.sh
   # Follow notes in NOTES-during-journey/argocd-install-PORT-FORWARD.md
   ```

3. **Explore practicals and YAMLs in the `stage-*` folders.**

## Project Structure

- **install-kind.sh, install-helm.sh**: Scripts to bootstrap your local Kubernetes environment.
- **multi-node-kind-cluster-config.yaml**: Kind cluster configuration for multi-node setups.
- **stage-1-practicals/**: Core Kubernetes objects (ConfigMaps, Secrets, Deployments, RBAC, etc.).
- **stage-2-practicals/**: Advanced objects and scenarios (StatefulSets, Ingress, Taints/Tolerations).
- **stage-3-practicals/**: Real-world deployment strategies (Canary, Rolling Updates), Kyverno policies.
- **stage-4-practicals/**: Reserved for further advanced topics.
- **tutors-yaml-files/**: Reference YAMLs from various Kubernetes educators.
- **NOTES-during-journey/**: Step-by-step notes, troubleshooting, and learning logs.

## Key Topics Covered

- Cluster setup with Kind
- Helm chart packaging and deployment
- ArgoCD for GitOps workflows
- Ingress and service networking
- ConfigMaps, Secrets, and RBAC
- StatefulSets and persistent storage
- Canary and rolling update strategies
- Policy enforcement with Kyverno
- Service mesh basics with Istio
